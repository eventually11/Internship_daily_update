# Summary
Due to an unresolved API issue causing error, I am temporarily skipping the API integration and proceeding with the implementation of the map chart.


Error: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://api.example.com/table-data. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed). Status code: (null).


AI respons: 
Server-Side CORS Configuration:

    Ensure the API server (https://api.example.com) has the appropriate CORS headers:

    http

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

Browser-Side Proxy (for development):

    You can create a proxy in your Vite configuration (vite.config.js):

    js

    export default {
      server: {
        proxy: {
          '/api': {
            target: 'https://api.example.com',
            changeOrigin: true,
            secure: false,
          },
        },
      },
    };

Check the Network Tab:

    Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Network tab to confirm if the request reaches the server or if itâ€™s blocked by the browser.


It does not work
