# Plan 
separate calculator project, develop the unittest

# Summary
I separated the calculator tests into test_calculator_base.py for testing functionality and test_coverage_runner.py for overall coverage.


The calculator was split into a core logic module and a user interface module for improved organization and clarity in development.
